# Logical-Operators
 Logical Operators are used to combine or manipulate boolean values. There are three logical operators: "&amp;&amp;" (and), "||" (or), and "!" (not). The "&amp;&amp;" operator returns true if both operands are true. The "||" operator returns true if at least one operand is true. The "!" operator negates the boolean value..
